## Introduction

Flake8 Numbers Plugin

This plugin ensures that large numbers of all bases are using digit seperators for improved readability.

Some examples of well written numeric literals are:

```python
good_float   = 123_456_789.123_456_789
good_hex     = 0xA_DEAD_BEEF
good_decimal = 10_000_000
good_binary  = 0b1010_1010_1010
```
