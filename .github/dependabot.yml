    # We group production and development ("optional" in the context of
    # pyproject.toml) dependency updates when they are patch and minor updates,
    # so we end up with less PRs being generated.
    # Major updates are still managed, but they'll create one PR per
    # dependency, as major updates are expected to be breaking, it is better to
    # manage them individually.
